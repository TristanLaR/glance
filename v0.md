# Glance — Product Requirements Document

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** January 2026

---

## Overview

Glance is a minimal, fast markdown viewer. Open a file, see it rendered. Nothing else.

---

## Problem

Reading markdown in the terminal sucks. Existing solutions are either bloated (Electron-based) or too feature-heavy. We want something that opens instantly, looks good, and stays out of the way.

---

## Solution

A native app that renders markdown in a clean window. No menus, no toolbars, no distractions. Just content.

---

## Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Hot reload | Watch file for changes, re-render automatically |
| Syntax highlighting | Code blocks highlighted via highlight.js |
| GitHub-style rendering | Familiar, readable styling |
| Mermaid diagrams | Render diagrams inline |

---

## Quality of Life

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Scroll preservation | Maintain scroll position on reload |
| Drag and drop | Drop .md file onto window to open |
| CLI support | `glance file.md` |
| OS file association | Right-click → Open with Glance |

---

## Polish

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Dark/light mode | Follow system preference |
| Keyboard shortcuts | Cmd+O open, Cmd+W close, Cmd+Plus/Minus zoom |
| Window title | Shows current filename |
| Window memory | Remember size and position |
| Copy code button | Appears on hover over code blocks |

---

## Non-Features

- No editing
- No tabs
- No sidebar
- No menu bar
- No toolbar
- No settings screen

---

## UI

Edge-to-edge rendered markdown with comfortable padding and max-width for readability. The only UI elements are:

- The rendered content
- Scrollbar
- Copy button (on hover over code blocks)

---

## Tech Stack

**Runtime:** Tauri (Rust + Webview)

**Rust crates:**
- `notify` — file watching

**Frontend libs:**
- `marked` — markdown parsing
- `highlight.js` — syntax highlighting
- `mermaid` — diagram rendering
- `github-markdown-css` — styling

---

## Target Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Binary size | < 10MB |
| Startup time | < 200ms |
| Total codebase | < 500 lines |

---

## Platforms

- macOS
- Windows
- Linux

---

## Future Considerations (v2+)

- Table of contents sidebar
- Recent files
- Frontmatter display
- LaTeX/math support
- Local .md link navigation

---

## Success Criteria

You run `glance README.md` and it just works. Fast, pretty, done.
